# Known Issues and Future Improvements

## Current Issues

1. **Authentication Error Handling**
   - Error: "useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider" - This issue occurs when Auth components try to access the AuthContext outside of its provider scope.
   - Fix: Ensure that the Auth and ResetPassword pages are properly wrapped with the AuthProvider.

2. **Database User Creation**
   - Issue with invalid JSON format in handle_new_user function when parsing metadata.
   - Fix applied: Added proper JSON handling with null checks and default values.

3. **Error Display in Auth Forms**
   - Inconsistent error handling in authentication forms.
   - Fix applied: Added try/catch blocks and improved error state management.

## Future Improvements

1. **Code Organization**
   - The Auth.tsx file (317 lines) is too long and should be refactored into smaller components.
   - The DeliveryReports.tsx file (281 lines) is also a candidate for refactoring.

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement React Query's caching capabilities for data fetching.
   - Add pagination for large data tables like messages and contacts.

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add Row Level Security policies to all database tables.
   - Implement proper input validation on all forms.

4. **User Experience**
   - Add loading indicators for asynchronous operations.
   - Improve form validation feedback.
   - Enhance mobile responsiveness.

5. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for critical components.
   - Implement end-to-end testing for authentication flows.
